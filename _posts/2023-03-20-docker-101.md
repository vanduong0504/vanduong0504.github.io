## Dive Into Docker
- **Why:** Easy to install and run sofware without worrying about setup or dependencies.
- **What:** An ecosystem around creating and running containers.
- **Core concepts:**
  - *Image:* Snapshot of file systems to run a program with some start up comands.
  - *Container:* Instance of an image for running a program.

## Docker Run in Detail

### Comand

| What | Comand | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Create and run a container from an image | `docker run <image_name> command!` | **run**: try to create and run the container <br /> **command!**: Default overide comand <br /> `docker run busybox ls` or `docker run busybox echo hi` |
| Listing running container | `docker ps -a!` | **ps**: list all *running* container  <br />  **-a**: listting all *created* container (--all) |
| Restarting stopped container | `docker start -a!` | **-a**: attach, allow to see output of container in terminal |
| Removing stopped container | `docker system prune` | |
| Retrieving log output | `docker logs <container_id>` | |
| Execute an additional command in a container | `docker exec -it <container id> <command>` |  **-it**: allow us to provide input to the container and output from container to screen  <br />  **command**: command to execute |

### Note
  - Docker container is isolate from each others.

## Building Custom Images

### Create a dockerfile
 ![image](../assets/img/docker-kubernetes/docker/3/1.png)

### Structure of dockerfile

`docker build -t <tag_name> <build context>`
  - **-t <tag_name>**: follow convention : `dockerId/projectName:version` (-t vanduong/redis:latest)
  - **build context**: file or folder using in build process

| What | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| FROM | Spcecify a base image | FROM alpine |
| RUN | Run comands to install additional program | RUN apk add --update redis |
| CMD | Comand to run on startup | CMD [ "redis-server" ]

## Reinforcement learning

Reinforcement learning is used when an algorithm needs to learn by trial and error. The algorithm interacts with an environment and receives rewards or punishments based on its actions. Some common reinforcement learning algorithms include:

- Q-learning
- Deep reinforcement learning
- Policy gradients

## Common algorithms

Here are some of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms:

| Algorithm | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Linear regression | Supervised learning | Fits a linear equation to the data |
| Logistic regression | Supervised learning | Predicts the probability of a binary outcome |
| K-means clustering | Unsupervised learning | Divides data into clusters based on similarity |
| Decision trees | Supervised learning | Builds a tree to make predictions based on if-then rules |
| Random forests | Supervised learning | Builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions |
| Support vector machines | Supervised learning | Finds a hyperplane that separates data into classes |

## Evaluation metrics

When evaluating a machine learning model, we need to use metrics that reflect how well the model is performing. Some common evaluation metrics include:

- **Accuracy:** The percentage of correctly predicted data points.
- **Precision:** The percentage of true positives among all predicted positives.
- **Recall:** The percentage of true positives among all actual positives.
- **F1 score:** A combination of precision and recall.
